# Final Project: Intro to Computer Security
### By: Nathan Metens (metens@pdx.edu)

In this final project, I conquered *3 TryHackMe rooms*. One of which was labeled as "Easy" difficulty, and the other two were "Medium". I also attempted a "Hard" one, but after 3 days, I couldn't figure it out. I know that difficulty level is subjective, depending on skill level and ability. I have low skill, but high ability to do anything, so I did as much as I could. However, these three TryHackMe rooms took almost two weeks to complete, racking in 2 hours per day.

Nevertheless, the video link showcasing all three rooms and how I solved them is found on YouTube at this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA7682ye9rg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA7682ye9rg)

The **documentation** (my work more thoroughly explained) for each of the rooms is [here](https://github.com/nmetens/Intro-to-Computer-Security/blob/main/final/final.md).

I learned plenty of security concepts throughout the process of completing these rooms and enjoyed the feeling of finally finding each flag to complete them.
