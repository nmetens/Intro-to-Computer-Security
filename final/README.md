This is the final project for Intro to Computer Security.

In this final project, I conquered 3 TryHackMe rooms. One of which was "easy" difficulty, and the other two were medium. However, none of them were easy at all.

The video link is showcasing all three rooms and how I solved them is located in the [video.txt](/video.txt) file, but it can also be found on YouTube at this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA7682ye9rg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA7682ye9rg)

The documentation of each of the two rooms is [here](/final.md)
