This is the final project for Intro to Computer Security.<br>

In this final project I conquered 3 TryHackMe rooms. One of which was "easy" dificulty, and the other two were medium. Although none of them were actually easy at all.

The video link is showcasing all three rooms and how I solved them is located in the [video.txt](/video.txt) file but it can also be found on Youtube at this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA7682ye9rg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA7682ye9rg)

The documentation of each two of the rooms is [here](/final.md)
