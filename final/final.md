## Intro

This is the final project for Intro to Computer Security. In this final, I attempted 4 TryHackMe Rooms. Three of them were successfully solved, the last one, I ran out of luck. The hardest one, was the one I couldn't solve, the easiest, was the "Security Footage" room. On average, each room took about 1-2 days to solve, working 3+ hours on each per day. This was a struggle, but I learned so much. I have a video [here]() where I go through each Room and how I solved it. This is just the documentation, explaining everything in text, showing images, and the code.
